TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that create many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way. On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one in 2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit. Nonetheless, everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade.",
